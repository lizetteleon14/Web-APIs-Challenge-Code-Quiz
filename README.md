            In this assignment, I created a timed quiz using javascript fundamentals that stores high scores. At the begining of the test, the student must click on the start quiz button in order to begin the exam, at that moment the timer starts and goes through a series of questions. Once the timer reaches 0 then the quiz alerts the user that the time is over and will ask the user for their initials and give them a score. The score the user receives will be placed on a high score chart that will be saved to the local storage so that the user can compare their score to their peers.
